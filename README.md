DelimPlot is a standalone Windows desktop app for plotting columns from plain-text data files.

It is designed for quick scientific and engineering plotting workflows: import delimited text, choose one X column and one or more Y series, tune the style, and save multiple graphs in a reusable project file.

## Features

- Import `.txt`, `.dat`, `.csv`, and `.tsv` data files.
- Auto-detect comma, tab, semicolon, and whitespace delimiters.
- Ignore common comment lines beginning with `#`, `//`, or `%`.
- Preview parsed numeric rows before plotting.
- Plot one X column against one or more Y columns.
- Configure line, scatter, and line + marker styles.
- Adjust line width, marker size, color, title, and axis labels.
- Manage multiple saved graphs in the Graph Browser.
- Save the current plot as PNG.
- Export and import `.delimplot` project files containing source data, graph settings, and graph thumbnails.
- Open `.delimplot` files directly with the DelimPlot executable.
- Render Chinese and other multilingual plot titles using system font selection.

## Sample Data

Example files are available in `samples/`:

- `trigonometric_waves.tsv`: tab-delimited sine, cosine, harmonic, and damped sine curves.
- `damped_oscillation.tsv`: tab-delimited damped displacement, velocity, and envelope curves.
- `signals_saw_square.csv`: comma-delimited sawtooth, square wave, random step, and pulse train signals.
- `conic_sections.dat`: whitespace-delimited ellipse branches, parabola, and hyperbola curves.
- `power_root_hyperbola.txt`: semicolon-delimited power, square-root, and inverse curves.

Each sample file uses the first column as the X coordinate and the remaining columns as Y series.

The sample project `samples/defaultProject.delimplot` can be opened directly with DelimPlot or imported from `File -> Import Project...`.

## Repository Layout

- `src/DelimPlot.Core`: data models and text parser.
- `src/DelimPlot.Plotting`: ScottPlot rendering helper.
- `src/DelimPlot.App`: Avalonia desktop application.
- `assets`: repository-level branding assets.
- `samples`: example data files.
- `screenshots`: release screenshots.

## Build

The repository includes a local .NET SDK under `.dotnet/` for this workspace. If you already have .NET 8 installed, `dotnet` can be used instead.

```powershell
.\.dotnet\dotnet.exe restore DelimPlot.sln
.\.dotnet\dotnet.exe build DelimPlot.sln --configuration Release
```

## Publish Windows Standalone

```powershell
.\.dotnet\dotnet.exe publish src\DelimPlot.App\DelimPlot.App.csproj --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishReadyToRun=false -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -o artifacts\win-x64
```

The standalone executable is:

```text
artifacts\win-x64\DelimPlot.exe
```

Release builds are published as:

```text
DelimPlot-0.1.0-win-x64.exe
DelimPlot-latest-win-x64.exe
```

## Project Files

Use `File -> Export Project...` to save a `.delimplot` file. This file bundles:

- imported source data files
- saved graph configurations
- graph browser thumbnails

Use `File -> Import Project...` or open the `.delimplot` file with DelimPlot to restore the workspace.
